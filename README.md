## What are Lucas Numbers?

In mathematics, the Lucas numbers or Lucas series are an integer sequence named after the mathematician François Édouard Anatole Lucas (1842–1891). They are defined as the series of numbers in the Lucas sequence, which starts with 2 and 1 and has the property that each number is the sum of its two immediate preceding numbers. The sequence thus goes: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, ... (OEIS A000032).

Formulas for the nth Lucas number are similar to those of the Fibonacci numbers. They are given by the following formula:

``` text
L(n) = φ^n + (1-φ)^n
```

where φ is the golden ratio, approximately 1.6180339887.
